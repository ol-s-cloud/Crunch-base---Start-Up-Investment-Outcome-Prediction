The outcome of the research suggests that of all the different models trained and tuned for this experiment, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) performed the best with a 91.6% recall rate, minimizing false results while logistic regression was the least performing model with about 16.8% recall rate. Although SHAP is useful for explaining predictions and providing insights into individual predictions, it however does not imply causality.
