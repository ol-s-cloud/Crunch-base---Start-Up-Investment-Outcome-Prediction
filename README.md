# Start-Up Investment Outcome Prediction

![Model Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ol-s-cloud/Start-Up-Investment-Outcome-Prediction/main/docs/images/model_architecture.svg)

A machine learning project that predicts startup IPO outcomes using ensemble methods and SHAP explanations. This research explores the transformative potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in predicting the probability of a possible IPO using binary classification by analyzing key features from data provided by Crunchbase.

This research adopts an ensemble approach to model development, utilizing a combination of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks to make predictions alongside with SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to address the concerns of explainability and transparency and to justify the predictions. See experiment set up below:

## Key Takeaways

- **Data Source**: For research purposes, Crunchbase provided full apis access to data and thus was able to work with **Crunchbase data** to analyze key features influencing IPO outcomes -- PS: ONLY ON UK START-UPS and All data used for this research is updated as at: August 7, 2023. This date serves as the snapshot for the dataset used in the study.

 More Details on Crunchbase Data here - https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/getting-started
 
- **Machine Learning Models**: Employed multiple models including:
  * Logistic Regression
  * XGBoost
  * Random Forests
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Neural Networks
- **Model Performance**: 
  * **XGBoost** performed best with a **91.6% recall rate**
  * **Logistic Regression** had the weakest recall at **16.8%**
- **Interpretability**: Used **SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)** to interpret and explain model predictions
- **Ethical Considerations**: 
  * Removed personal information
  * Avoided look-ahead bias
- **Research Scope**: 
  * Focused on **UK-based start-ups**
  * Analyzed data from **1999-2020**
- **Future Recommendations**: 
  * Integrate **time-series analysis**

## Key Features

- Ensemble approach combining multiple ML models
- SHAP explanations for model interpretability
- Comprehensive startup data analysis
- High accuracy predictive capabilities
- Extensive feature engineering

##  Quick Start
(not sure you'd need this but just incase. For the full python repository and code version, I'll maybe be deploying that here on my spare time --- see: https://github.com/ol-s-cloud/start-up-inv-co-pilot)

**Note**: This research was primarily conducted using Orange Data Studio, an open-source machine learning and data visualization platform that played a crucial role in model development and analysis.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ol-s-cloud/Start-Up-Investment-Outcome-Prediction.git

# Set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run sample prediction
python src/predict.py --sample data/example.csv
```

##  Model Performance

Results from the ensemble models:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|--------|
| AUC | 0.993 |
| Accuracy | 0.996 |
| F1 Score | 0.954 |
| Precision | 0.996 |
| Recall | 0.916 |

## ROC Analysis Curve 
![ROC Analysis Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ol-s-cloud/Start-Up-Investment-Outcome-Prediction/main/Files/ROC%20Analysis%20Curve.png)

The outcome of the research suggests that of all the different models trained and tuned for this experiment, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) performed the best with a 91.6% recall rate, minimizing false results while logistic regression was the least performing model with about 16.8% recall rate. Although SHAP is useful for explaining predictions and providing insights into individual predictions, it however does not imply causality.
