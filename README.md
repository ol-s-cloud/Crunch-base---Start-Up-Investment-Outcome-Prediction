# Start-Up Investment Outcome Prediction

![Model Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ol-s-cloud/Start-Up-Investment-Outcome-Prediction/main/docs/images/model_architecture.svg)

A machine learning project that predicts startup IPO outcomes using ensemble methods and SHAP explanations. This research explores the transformative potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence in predicting the probability of a possible IPO using binary classification by analyzing key features from data provided by Crunchbase.

In this research we adopt an ensemble approach to model development, utilizing a combination of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks to make predictions alongside with SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to address the concerns of explainability and transparency and to justify the predictions. See experiment set up below:
